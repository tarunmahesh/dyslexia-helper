            Dyslexia is a neurological condition that affects the way individuals process written language, leading to difficulties in reading, spelling, and writing, despite having average to above-average intelligence. People with dyslexia may face challenges in recognizing and decoding words, often experiencing difficulties with phonological processing. Dyslexia is a lifelong condition, but with appropriate support and interventions, individuals can develop strategies to cope with its impact.
